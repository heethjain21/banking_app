My Grade 10 ISCE Board Project
<br>Subject: Computer Application 


### Current System

- You have to go to the Bank for information and update process.
- You need a person to help you with the information.
- You need to go to different department for different information and wait in long ques.
- Or you need a person to chat with you on the other side.
- It is tedious and consumes time.
- You can visit Bank on specific days and on specific timings.

### Proposed System

- You will have to chat with a simple chat-bot which gives you information regarding this bank.
- It understands language of banking only related to this bank only as it is specially made for this bank.
- Just enter the department of which you need update and the chat-bot will help you in it.
- It has all the facilities that the bank serves.
- It is connected online and has login feature to keep your account secure.

### Advantages

- No need to go to bank for information when you have the bank with you.
- The program gives you a polite, smart and convenient to chat chat-bot with you.
- No need to wait in long ques for different departments for different information when you have a chat-bot to give you updates from each departments. Only you have to enter the department you want to receive the update from.
- No need for a person to sit on the other side to give you information when you have a simple chat-bot to provide you information related to the bank.
- It saves time as you have to just enter what information you need and it gives you in no time.
- You can use it at any time you like.
